To have Cucumber Running perfectly on your Eclipse, you need to download several JAR files and Apache POI. 
Also you need to add them to your project library.

To Download Apache POI,

go to http://poi.apache.org/download.html

Download zip version of poi-bin file

After downloading it gather all the jar files in poi, poi/ooxml-lib and poi/lib folders

After gathering them together. Open Eclipse,

File --> New --> Java Project --> Enter the Name of the Project then Press Next --> Click Libraries
--> Add External JARs --> Select all the jars you gathered together.

Also you need to download JAR Files for Cucumber
